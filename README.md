#  Salifort Motors: Employee Attrition Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee turnover at Salifort Motors. As a data consultant, I analyzed HR data to identify key factors driving employees to leave and built a machine learning model to help the company retain its top talent.

##  Key Insights
- **Burnout is Real:** High project loads and excessive monthly hours were the top predictors of attrition.
- **Satisfaction Matters:** Employees with low satisfaction scores and long tenures were at high risk.
- **Model Integrity:** Features like `satisfaction_level` were handled carefully to ensure the model's reliability in real-world scenarios.

##  Model Performance
The final model achieved outstanding results:
- **Champion Model:** Random Forest.
- **AUC Score:** **96.4%** (Extremely high precision in identifying at-risk employees).

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python.
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Deployment Ready:** Models saved as `.pkl` files for easy integration.
